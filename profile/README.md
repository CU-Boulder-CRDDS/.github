## Welcome to CRDDS' GitHub repository

Established in 2017, the [Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/) (CRDDS) is a partnership between [Research Computing](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/) and the [University Libraries](https://www.colorado.edu/libraries/) at University of Colorado Boulder. We are a collaborative team of data and information professionals, scholars, and educators with expertise in data-intensive scholarship and teaching. Our goal is to serve as an interdisciplinary hub and resource on campus that empowers everyone as they navigate the [Research Lifecycle](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/what-we-do/research-lifecycle), through workshops and seminars, certificate programs, and collaborative opportunities. We look forward to working with you on your research efforts and welcome opportunities for ongoing collaborations.

On this page, you'll find guides, slide decks, and workshop materials for researchers at CU Boulder.

Feel free to [contact us](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/contact-us) about anything on our GitHub site or any other aspects of research data!
